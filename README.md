# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Playground

Welcome to my personal playground for experimenting with **prompt engineering** techniques using large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4.

This project is part of my GenAI upskilling path. It focuses on learning how prompt structure impacts output quality, tone, reasoning, and task performance.
