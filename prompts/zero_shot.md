# Zero shot prompt

### What "Zero-Shot" Means

- "Zero-shot" means the model is expected to handle the task based only on the instructions, not by learning from examples within the prompt.

- It relies purely on the modelâ€™s pre-trained knowledge.



# ðŸ§  Zero-Shot Prompt Examples

This file contains examples of zero-shot prompts â€” where we ask the LLM to perform a task without giving it any prior examples.

Each section contains:
- The prompt used
- The model (e.g., GPT-3.5)
- The LLM output (optional placeholder)
- Notes on the promptâ€™s effectiveness
